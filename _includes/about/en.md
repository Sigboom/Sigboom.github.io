>  Wow another man.

I'm Doni Danile, a student of NEFU (Northeast Forestry University). I Major in IMIS, so if you get my timetable, you will find some classes like Economics, management, accounting and so on. I have to admit that I was't good at them, But I'm skillful in the classes like C/C++ Programming language design.
Try my best to find what I can get information from my school. Then here is what I get in my university time(I'm a junior now, and next semester I will be a senior).

|language|proficiency|Try to do something|
|---|---|---|
|C/C++|Proficient (What I like best)|Raspberry pie health system, Chinese character multimode matching|
|Matlab|skilled|Mathematical modeling (Sadly, it's all about participation)|
|Python|skilled|Data visualization (such as my QQ & Wechat avatar)|
